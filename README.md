# QR Code Scavenger Hunt

This is a simple skeleton for a QR Code Scavenger hunt webapp. My usecase is as follows:

1. I want the ability to make a grid of clues for the scavenger hunt. The user would tap into a clue.
2. The clue screen would show a text clue, but also an image (optional).
3. The clue screen gives two options for completion: scanning a QR code with their phone's camera, or inputting a text string.
4. When successful, the user is given feedback and taken back to the main screen. Their progress is shown and saved.
5. When the user finishes, a message is displayed.

This was made with the aid of Claude Code.
